### Hi, I'm Troy 👋🏼 🧑🏻‍💻

I am a machine learning engineer who is passionate leveraging data and machine learning to build better products and building community. I primarily work in Python but enjoy popular technologies including ReactJS, APIs, GraphQL, and streaming applications. My interests are in end-to-end machine learning model deployment with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transfer learning using state-of-the-art methods/models.

- 👯 I’m always on the lookout for possible project collaboration in NLP and CV projects
- 🤝 I'm a "build-as-you-grow" type who is passionate about helping others hone their craft in data science and machine learning
- 👀 Always looking for opportunities where I can blend modeling, engineering, and product-sense to build high-impact solutions
